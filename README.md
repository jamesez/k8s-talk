This is the slides & script from a talk I gave to ITS deskside support staff, May 2022. It's not intended to be an in-depth review of Kubernetes, but an overview of how we got to it, how we use it, and why I like it.

A Zoom recording of this talk is available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTzf7mWUDVE
